<p>
  Hello my friend ðŸ‘‹ I'am <b>Farzad Ebrahimi</b>
  I was born in 2006 and currently live in Tehran. </br>
  I am a student studying software engineering and computer science ðŸ“š </br>
  I ðŸ’– programming and the big world of IT and i have small projects that you can see on my GitHub.
  Most of my activity in cyberspace is on the Discord platform and I am not anywhere else
  Actually.
  I am interested in back-end and desktop programming, and I don't like front-end programming. I often program my projects with Python and C# programming languages â€‹â€‹(I am generally interested in machine programming).
  
  <b>How did I discover my interest in Programming?</b></br>
  When I was in the third grade of elementary school, I had an old computer. I always went around with it and tried to find new things on it.From there, my interest in the computer world was formed.I grew up and learned more about computers and got acquainted with the    concept of programming. It was there that I fell in love with this profession because I could develop the computer world with it. And now I am here and I will stay here to reach my **goal !** ðŸ˜‰
